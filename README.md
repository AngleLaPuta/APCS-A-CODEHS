For legal reasons, let it be known that this code is only intended as a reference and for assistance purposes. Any attempts to use it for cheating would be highly frowned upon and may lead to serious consequences. And as for CodeHS, just pretend you never saw this.

Shoutout to the chatgpt devs for coming up with the code for some of the later sections.

Also I'm not gonna be linking any of the Tester files ya'll should know how to do that at the very least.
